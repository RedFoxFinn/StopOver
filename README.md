# StopOver - Frontend

The frontend of the app. Without this one there wouldn't be graphical application to use. Neat.

## Libraries to highlight

- React for building components, views.. all of it basicly
- Redux (newer toolkit-version) for managing the application state (sure, context and useState are cool but sometimes global state just is worth it) with additional help from react-redux
- Apollo (GraphQL) for keeping routing and timetable data updated for you
- MUI (Material UI) for more consistent elements
- React router for handling different views
- Axios for geocoding data querying
